    <h2 > The Beginning: </h2>
      <p> Since she was born in a Catholic Christian family she was a great believer of God and humanity. Although she spends most of her life in the church she never imagines herself to be a nun one day. When she visited Kolkata (Calcutta), India after completing her work in Dublin her life completely changed. For 15 consecutive years, she enjoyed teaching children.</p>
      <h2> Her Missionary:</h2>
      <p> For doing this great work of teaching poor and helping needy people she wants a permanent place. This place will serve as her headquarters and a place where poor and homeless can take shelter.</p>
<p>
So, with the help of the church and the people, she established a missionary where poor and homeless can live and die in peace. Later on, she manages to open several schools, homes, dispensaries, and hospitals through her NGO both in India and overseas countries.</p>
      <h2> Death and Memorial:</h2>
      </p>She was an angel of hope for the people but death spares no one. And this gem died serving people in Kolkata (Calcutta). Also, on her death the whole nation shred tears in her memory. With her death the poor, needy, homeless, and weak again become orphans.</p>
<p>
Many memorials were made in her honor by the Indian people. Apart from that, foreign countries also make several memorials to give tribute to her.</p>
